## Economic Model
As the Constellation network grows in a self-similar incentivized fashion, the question is how the utility value of the network projects into the future and how it interacts with the liquidity injected by the reserve and the supply.

We propose the Constellation Token Model, a distributed consensus protocol inspired by generative economies and aimed at producing inherent utility value for the token in the network. The generation and perpetuation of true utility can be likened to the production of a real-world commodity. $DAG as a digital commodity therefore opens the opportunity to well established and known market dynamics. In that manner we propose a solution to a sustainable token utiltiy in a reputation governed $DAG protocol.

This is a first very rough draft and work on this will be ongoing, with more commits to be expected as we finalize our model.
